     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  16 17
    
## the digits 2 3 4 5 represent the type of schedule according to usali

         0000 Summary Operating Statement for Operators/Owners
         
## the digits 7 8 9 10 allow us to create a logical order within the type of schedule

        H0100-0200-00 Transient Rooms Revenue

        H0100-0202-01 Retail Room Revenue
        H0100-0204-01 Discount .Revenue
        H0100-0206-01 Negotiated R.Revenue
        H0100-0208-01 Reward Redemption

##the digits 12 13 14 15 for/from 1C

## the digits 16 17 visually define the data type

         00 - an informative line
         01 - a value obtained from the initial data.
         02 - a calculated value
         22 - total calculated value representing 100%

         04 - a calculated or obtained value that will be used as a global parameter at the start of all
             the schedules except in the type of schedule where it was defined (see digits 2 3 4 5)

 ##          For example, in schedule 0000 we define

                 H0000-0200-04 Rooms Occupied (Sold)

                 which is equal to

                 H0000-0200-02 Rooms Occupied (Sold)

                 but with 04,
                
                 H0000-0200-04 Rooms Occupied (Sold)
                
                 because it is 04 it will appear in the header of all schedules except 0000

##                 So we can define parameters that appear in all schedules
                     Rooms available
                     Occupation
                     ADR
                     Rooms RevPar
                     Total RevPar
